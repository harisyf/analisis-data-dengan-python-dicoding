# Brazilian E-Commerce RFM Analysis

Hello and welcome to my RFM analysis project. This project used dataset that available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) website.  Feel free to explore my project. You can also visit the web app of this project dashboard in this [[link]](https://rfm-analysis-in-ecommerce-dashboard-haris.streamlit.app/).

  # Background
  RFM analysis is one of the widely used technique to gain insight into customer behavior and segmentation that categorizes customers based on three key metrics: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. This project aims to do RFM Analysis on E-commerce where the dataset is public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information on 100 thousand orders from 2016 to 2018 made in several marketplaces in Brazil. Beside RFM analysis, I also performed data exploration to gain more insight from the dataset.
  
  # Analysis Questions
  1. How is the segmentation of customers based on order recency, order frequency, and transaction value?
  2. What is the distribution of customers who used e-commerce the last time they placed an order?
  3. Which state have the most and fewest customer orders?
  4. Which state has the highest total and average transaction value?
  5. Which month has the highest total and average transaction value?

  # Objective
  The aim of this project is to find out customer segmentation insights based on order recency, orders, frequency and transaction value as well as to get other insights such as the distribution of customers when they last placed an order, customer orders and transaction value. Therefore, I carry out data analysis using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Analysis (RFM) so that I can conclude information to help in decision making.

  # Method
  The method I used in this project was Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by analyzing the data and visualizing it to gain a better understanding. The features of the dataset I use are order ID, customer ID, approved orders, and payment value. I also create a dashboard using Streamlit to show the data visualization on [web app](https://rfm-analysis-in-ecommerce-dashboard-haris.streamlit.app/).

  # Conclusion
  After analyzing the data, I can draw conclusions based on the results of the analysis to help answer the questions I raised.

  1. With the RFM analysis that has been carried out, the results can be concluded:
      * Based on recency, the customer made a purchase some time ago but has not been active recently,
      * based on frequency, customers only make one purchase and there are no repeat purchases,
      * Based on the monetary side, customers tend to buy with a fairly high spending value.
  2. The distribution of customers who used e-commerce the last time they placed an order tends to be right skewed because the longest number of days a customer has not placed an order decreases, whereas most customers tend to use e-commerce to place an order between 0-300 days.
  3. The state with the most orders by customers is the SP state and the state with the fewest orders by users is the RR state.
  4. The state with the highest total transaction value is SP State and the highest average transaction value is PB State.
  5. The month with the highest total transaction value was November 2017 and the highest average transaction value was October 2016.
